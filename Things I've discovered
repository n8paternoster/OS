We're getting a page fault on 
ch := inch() 

the very first time. Maybe we have to figure out page faults first?

Also one piece of the puzzle of what the heck we're doing is that some of those pointers in the manifest
of the startup code are function pointers. One or some of them are related to the interrupt vector. 
So we don't have to detect interrupts, that's done for us, all we have to do is somehow set the function pointer for interrupts
equal to our "deal with interrupts" function and our function will automatically be called when an interrupt is called.
